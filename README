To compile the sources Visual Studio 2012 is needed. Open the Solution file with VS and hit build. Everything should build fine. There are 2 executable projects(ConsoleServer and Client) which will produce executable binaries.
The application runs on windows 7 but .NET 4.5 is needed. (AFAIK you need VS2012 to develop for .net4.5)
